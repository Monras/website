        ÆSIR was created to provide a forum for students with an interest in rocket propulsion, where they can develop their passion. The activities of the association will further strengthen KTH position as a leading Aerospace University. 

        Our mission is to become one of the top student organizations for rocket building in the world, by breaking and holding the student altitude records (which is currently 21.5 kilometers). Ultimately, we intend to break the worldwide altitude record and reach altitudes beyond the 120 kilometer mark.
