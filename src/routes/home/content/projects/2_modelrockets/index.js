  During the fall of 2017, we started up a model rocketry project. One might argue that it does not serve our goal of reaching the edge of space, but it's a project which is might be more approachable for our less experienced members.

  More pictures of a model rocket launch we conducted in April 2017 can be found [in this post on our Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/aesirkth/posts/1776580436003857)!
