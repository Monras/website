  We are currently working towards a late 2017 launch of Odin, a tiny yet powerful rocket.

  Odin will be our first sounding rocket, with a thrust of about 3kN. Just like the norse god Odin gave an eye for wisdom, our rocket Odin will give us valuable knowledge on constructing rockets.
  So far, we have conducted two static firings of our rocket motor and are preparing a third test.
